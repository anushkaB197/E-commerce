**Problem**
 As a business owner in the e-commerce sector, I am currently operating without the aid of any digital solutions.

**About the Business**
 My product line consists of a variety of items, each identified by a unique code and accompanied by a detailed description.

**Process**
 Customers interact with my business by placing orders from this list of products.
 I identify my customers using their first name, last name, email, and address.

**Payment**
 Each customer transaction involves a specific payment method.

**Follow-Up**
 Upon the completion of a successful payment transaction, I take the responsibility to inform the customer via emailâ€”confirming the success of their payment or, conversely, notifying them of any payment failures.

**Business Growth**
 In a bid to streamline operations and promote growth within my business, I am looking to invest in the development of a dedicated application.

**Goal**
 This application will serve to simplify my business processes and contribute significantly to the overall efficiency and scalability of my online venture.
